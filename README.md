##  Introduction

This program can be handle to calculate the area of triangle in different options. It also significantly reduces time complexity of calculating and makes more efficient.
### Let's see how we made it

First you are supposed to choose one of the options to continue

If you choose second option, you'll be asked to enter the three sides of triangle.
And then it decides if it is valid or not to calcualte
